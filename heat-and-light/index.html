Who then starts sending salesmen to convince citizens to sign away their mineral rights.</p><p>This was my first Jennifer Haigh novel. There was definitely a lot of drama and tension in this book. It was a smooth transition from the potential financial profit from drilling in Bakerton to the inevitable conflicts caused by greed and power.</p><p>Ultimately, this is a story about the impact of fossil fuels on people, communities, and the environment. I enjoyed the approach of focusing on the citizens of Bakerton. I wasn’t bombarded with a lot of technical jargon and information about drilling. It more-or-less quietly sat in the background. Raw human emotion drove the story.</p>undefined<p><b>Thumbs Up</b></p><p>The various POVs highlighted the opposing motives and added to the fracking debate. Jennifer Haigh has a talent for infusing humanity into her characters and making connections.</p><p>There were a few characters that I spent much of the time focusing on: Rich Devlin leases his mineral rights in hopes of being able to finance his dream farm on this father’s property. His wife, Shelby later becomes paranoid about the health effects the drilling has on their frail daughter. Rena and her partner Mack own an organic farm and the drilling in the surrounding area is having a negative impact on their ability to sell their products. Then there’s Herc, who is a manager on the drill site.</p><p><b>Thumbs Down</b></p><p>This novel would have been stronger if it weren’t for long list of cast members! Geez, how many POVs does one book truly need? Books with a few POVs don’t typically bother me but I draw the line at 2 or 3. Heat & Light just toted too many characters for me- I lost count after 8. Personally, I found a few sections to be completely unnecessary.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In theory, the story would have been more engaging with: Rich Devlin, Shelby Devlin, Rena, and Herc. I didn’t particularly care to read personal accounts from the pastor, the random workers, Mac, Kip, Lorne, Darren, or Wes. Though some of these accounts were brief, it felt a little out of place and took me out of the story. It was actually exhausting to try to remember who all these people were. I felt forced to follow minor characters made them seem important only to realize… they weren’t THAT important. The flashback sections were a bit random and difficult for me to finish. I lost interest and found myself skimming over the words. In my opinion, they could have been cut altogether or presented in a different way. </p><p><b>Overall Thoughts</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>Overall, I would recommend this book. It’s very fairly entertaining and the characters feel like people you have known all your life. The ending isn’t neat and doesn’t provide answers for everything- this is a story about people’s lives. It doesn’t have a big conclusion because their lives are not over and the effects of the drilling still linger long after the drilling has ended.</p>undefined</div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26">Heat &amp; Light</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
